# Car-Simulation-using-python

Alex is tasked with developing a simulation for a car starting from a parking lot. Implement
methods to accelerate the car and apply brakes to adjust its speed as it moves. Create a class
called Car with attributes for color, speed, and model. Add methods to
accelerate(speed_increment) and brake(speed_decrement).
• Input Example: Car('red', 0, 'sedan'), accelerate(30), brake(10)
• Sample Input:
• car = Car('red', 0, 'sedan')
• car.accelerate(30)
  car.brake(10)
